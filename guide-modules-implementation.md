# Overview

Shuttle.Esb is extensible via modules.  These typically plug into a relevant pipeline to perform additional tasks within the pipeline.

## Implementation

A module is an implementation of the `IModule` interface and this, in turn, implements the `IRequireInitialization` interface.

~~~ c#
    public class LogMessageOwnerModule : IModule
    {
		private readonly string _inboxMessagePipelineName = typeof(InboxMessagePipeline).FullName;

		public void Initialize(IServiceBus bus)
		{
			Guard.AgainstNull(bus, "bus");

			bus.Events.PipelineCreated += PipelineCreated;
		}

		private void PipelineCreated(object sender, PipelineEventArgs e)
		{
			if (!e.Pipeline.GetType().FullName.Equals(_inboxMessagePipelineName, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))
			{
				return;
			}

			e.Pipeline.RegisterObserver(new LogMessageOwnerObserver());
		}
    }
~~~

So here we have create a new module that registers the `LogMessageOwnerObserver` for each newly created `InboxMessagePipeline`.  Since a pipeline simply raises `PipelineEvent` instances the observer will need to listen out for the relevant events.  We will log the message owner after the transport message has been deserialized:

~~~ c#
	public class LogMessageOwnerObserver : IPipelineObserver<OnAfterDeserializeTransportMessage>
	{
		public void Execute(OnDeserializeTransportMessage pipelineEvent)
		{
			var state = pipelineEvent.Pipeline.State;
			var transportMessage = state.GetTransportMessage();
			
			if (transportMessage == null)
			{
				return;
			}
			
			Console.Log("This transport message belongs to '{0}'.", transportMessage.PrincipalIdentityName);
		}
	}
~~~

Each pipeline has a state that contains various items.  You can add state and there are some extensions on the state that return various well-known items such as `GetTransportMessage()` that returns the `TransportMessage` on the pipeline.  Prior to deserializing the transport message it will, of course, be `null`.

Pipelines are re-used so they are created as needed and returned to a pool.  Should a pipeline be retrieved from the pool it will be re-initialized so that the previous state is removed.

To use the module it will need to be referenced in the relevant endpoint and added to the `Modules` collection for the service bus configuration

Using code:

~~~ c#
	bus = ServiceBus
		.Create(c => c.AddModule(new LogMessageOwnerModule()))
		.Start();
~~~

Via the configuration file:

~~~ xml
	<modules>
		<add type="Shuttle.Esb.Modules.LogMessageOwnerModule, Shuttle.Esb.Modules" />
	</modules>
~~~

# Pipelines

You can refernce the [Shuttle.Esb](https://github.com/Shuttle/Shuttle.Esb/tree/master/Shuttle.Esb/Pipeline/Pipelines) code directly to get more information on the available pipelines and the events in those pipelines.
