A new release of the Shuttle.Esb.RabbitMQ nuget package is available.

Connection failures should be correctly retried with this version.

# .NET 3.5 support ended

During this refactoring process it came to light that the latest RabbitMQ.Client (v3.5.1) no longer support .NET 3.5 which means that the Shuttle.Esb.RabbitMQ implementation also no longer can support .NET 3.5.

Hopefully this will not affect too many folks.  The older versions are still available, though.
