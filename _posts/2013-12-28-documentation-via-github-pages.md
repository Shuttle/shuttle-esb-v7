I decided to go with GitHub Pages for our documentation.  Getting Jekyll working locally on Windows 8 was somewhat tricky but I have ended upwith a structure that I am happy with.

Initially I tried using Flatdoc and the HighlightJS for the the -orentied pages but using the templates and syntax highlighting through Jekyll and Pygments directly to produce static pages ended up being a bit simpler.
